To test the entry page, it is sufficient to just use ab.

To test the JSON request, we can create a file with the request
by copy&pasting everything from the chrome network tab (view source).

For creating a scheme, we can use:
ab -n 1000 -c 100 -p post_data_req -v 4 -T 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' http://127.0.0.1:7777/tutor/jq/request

For extending a proof, we can use (adapt proof id and make sure rule is applicable)
ab -n 1000 -c 100 -p post_data_proof -v 4 -T 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' http://127.0.0.1:7777/tutor/jq/request
