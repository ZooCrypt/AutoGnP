UI:
- start websocket server on directory or file
  - directory: display list of .zc files in current directory
    - select file => show file and start PROOF-MODE
    - new file: create file and start PROOF-MODE
  - file: start PROOF-MODE

How to handle read-only for a region in ACE?
We remove the lock as soon as something changes.
1. On successful processing, store position + content
2. On change, check longest prefix that is still the
   the same with previous locked content.
    If not the whole locked text, search backward for
    '.' revert to this proof-state.
